# bracket-muncher

A simple program that takes a single Challonge tournament url as an argument and returns a JSON object describing the bracket, all the matches, and the players that participated.

(This was made in ~1 hour as more as a challenge than for any practical reason)

To run, simple have node.js installed and run the command `node index <url>` and replace `<url>` with your bracket of choice.
